<A NAME="overview"><H2>1. Overview</H2></A>

<P>
The two key remote interfaces in Slides
are interface <A HREF="Screen.html">Screen</A>
and interface <A HREF="Projector.html">Projector</A>.

<P>
A <B>screen</B> is an object
that displays slides on some medium.
For example,
a digital projector in a classroom or auditorium
might provide a permanent screen service
for displaying slides at the front of the room.
For another example,
an individual's mobile computing device,
like a PDA, laptop PC, or tablet PC,
might provide a screen service
for displaying slides on the device's screen.

<P>
A <B>projector</B> is an object
that provides slides for a screen to display.
A projector object advertises
the slides it has available.
A screen object obtains slides from the projector object.
By providing a projector object,
discovering one or more screen objects,
and telling the screen object(s)
to display a sequence of slides,
a client application can make a slide show appear
on the screen objects.

<P>
A <B>theatre</B> is a group of screen objects and projector objects
that are collaborating to do a slide presentation.
Each theatre has a name.
The screen objects in a theatre
display the slides
from the projector objects in the theatre.
Different theatres with different names
display separate slide presentations.

<P>
Here is a typical setup.
A classroom has a permanent screen service (object)
driving a (physical) digital projector
and attached to a wireless network.
A professor comes to class
with a wireless tablet PC
that has a client application
with a projector object and a bunch of slides.
As the professor taps the tablet PC's display,
the client application uses M2MI
to send the slides to the screen service
and display the slides one by one
at the front of the room.
Simultaneously, students can run screen services on their laptop PCs
and see the same slide presentation up close
on their laptop screens.

<P>
Better still,
a screen object can display multiple slides at once --
just like putting multiple transparencies
on an old-fashioned overhead projector.
In this way, multiple slide projectors can collaborate
to produce a combined slide presentation.
The pieces of the overall slide presentation
don't have to be integrated together ahead of time,
and the devices with the slide projectors
don't have to know about each other ahead of time.
The multiple slide projectors and screen services
automatically form an ad hoc collaborative application
where the slides from all the slide projectors
are displayed on all the screen services.

<A NAME="running"><H2>2. Running the Slides Application</H2></A>

<P>
To run the Slides application,
do the following steps on each participating machine.
There must be at least one machine
running an instance of the Slide Screen
and at least one machine
running an instance of the Slide Projector.

<OL TYPE=1>

<LI>
Configure the M2MI Layer.
See package <A HREF="../m2mi/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mi</A>
and class <A HREF="../m2mi/M2MIProperties.html">M2MIProperties</A>
for further information.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
Configure the M2MP Layer
and run the M2MP Daemon in a separate process.
See package <A HREF="../m2mp/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp</A>,
class <A HREF="../m2mp/M2MPProperties.html">M2MPProperties</A>,
and class <A HREF="../m2mp/Daemon.html">Daemon</A>
for further information.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
Run an instance of the Slide Screen
by typing this command
in a separate process:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java edu.rit.slides.SlideScreen</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The application displays a window:
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
The Slide Screen automatically discovers
all existing theatres
and displays them in the list at the right.
To make the Slide Screen join one of the existing theatres,
click on the theatre name in the theatre list.
To make the Slide Screen create and join a new theatre,
click the "New Theatre..." button.
To make the Slide Screen not part of any theatre,
click "&lt;none&gt;" in the theatre list.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
The slide or slides being projected
by the Slide Projectors in the theatre
are displayed in the large area
at the left.
If no slides are being projected,
or if the Slide Screen is not part of a theatre,
this area is black.
To show the slides on the full screen,
click the "Slide Show" button.
To return to the Slide Show window display,
click the mouse button.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
Run an instance of the Slide Projector
by typing this command
in a separate process:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java edu.rit.slides.SlideProjector</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The application displays a window:
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
The Slide Projector automatically discovers
all existing theatres
and displays them in the list at the right.
To make the Slide Projector join one of the existing theatres,
click on the theatre name in the theatre list.
To make the Slide Projector create and join a new theatre,
click the "New Theatre..." button.
To make the Slide Projector not part of any theatre,
click "&lt;none&gt;" in the theatre list.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>
Click the "Open..." button
to open a slide show.
In the file dialog,
select the file that contains the desired slide show.
The slide show file must contain
an instance of class <A HREF="SlideShow.html">SlideShow</A>
in serialized form written using Java object serialization.
The M2MI Library contains two example slide show files
in the directory <TT>"lib/edu/rit/slides/test/"</TT>,
file <TT>"SlideShow01.ss"</TT>
and file <TT>"SlideShow02.ss"</TT>.
The first slide appears in the Slide Projector window
and in every Slide Screen that is part of the same theatre:

Click the "Next slide", "Previous slide",
"First slide", and "Last slide" buttons
to move through the slide show.
You can also click on the slide itself
to move to the next slide.
You can also use the following keys for navigation:

Click the "Blank" button
to make the Slide Projector temporarily stop projecting slides.
This will cause all the Slide Screens in the theatre
to go blank
(unless another Slide Projector is still projecting slides).
While the Slide Projector is blanked,
you can change theatres,
navigate through the slide show,
or open another slide show.
Click the "Unblank" button
to make the Slide Projector start projecting slides again.

<A NAME="creating"><H2>3. Creating a Slide Show</H2></A>

<P>
As stated above, the Slide Projector reads a file
containing an instance of class <A HREF="SlideShow.html">SlideShow</A>
in serialized form written using Java object serialization.
The M2MI Library does not at present
include a WYSIWYG application
for creating slide show files.
However, you can write a Java program
to create a <A HREF="SlideShow.html">SlideShow</A> object
and serialize it into a file.
To learn how, study the source code
for classes <A HREF="test/SlideShow01.html">SlideShow01</A>
and <A HREF="test/SlideShow02.html">SlideShow02</A>
in package <A HREF="test/package-summary.html">edu.rit.slides.test</A>.
Class <A HREF="test/SlideShow01.html">SlideShow01</A>
created the file <TT>"SlideShow01.ss"</TT>.
Class <A HREF="test/SlideShow02.html">SlideShow02</A>
created the file <TT>"SlideShow02.ss"</TT>.

<P>
Each <A HREF="SlideShow.html">SlideShow</A> object
contains a number of <A HREF="Slide.html">Slide</A> objects.
Each <A HREF="Slide.html">Slide</A> object in turn
contains a number of <A HREF="items/SlideItem.html">SlideItem</A> objects.
Package <A HREF="items/package-summary.html">edu.rit.slides.items</A>
provides various kinds of slide items,
including text, images, rectangles, and lines
with various bullets, colors, outlines, and arrows.
You can also write your own subclasses
of class <A HREF="items/SlideItem.html">SlideItem</A>
to define your own kinds of slide items.
