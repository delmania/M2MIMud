<P>
With the RIT Classfile Library
you can analyze an existing class file
to discover which class, fields, methods, and so on
it contains.
While you can get the same information
using the Java Reflection API
(package java.lang.reflect),
the Java Reflection API first requires you
to load the class into the JVM.
The RIT Classfile Library can analyze a class file
without actually loading the class.
Also, since it doesn&#146;t use reflection,
the RIT Classfile Library
can be used in Java environments that lack reflection,
such as the Java 2 Micro Edition Connected Limited Device Configuration
(J2ME CLDC).
<P>
<I>Note:
The RIT Classfile Library&#146;s analysis capabilities
are not yet implemented
and will appear in a future version
of the Library.</I>
<P>
With the RIT Classfile Library
you can also synthesize a new class file
and load it directly into the JVM.
In this way, a running program can create a new class
without having to generate a source file
and run the Java compiler.
Thus, the RIT Classfile Library
can be used to create new classes
in Java environments that lack a Java compiler
and/or a file system,
such as the J2ME CLDC.
<P>
The original motivation
for writing the RIT Classfile Library
was to enable the development
of remote method invocation systems
that generate their own stubs automatically
rather than relying on a human
to run an offline stub compiler.
Java&#146;s dynamic proxies (class java.lang.reflect.Proxy)
provide a similar capability.
However, custom-synthesized stub classes
generally execute more quickly
than dynamic proxies that use reflection,
and hence are more attractive
in applications where performance is a concern.
Also, the RIT Classfile Library
is fully general
and can synthesize <I>any</I> class,
not just a proxy for an interface.

<P>
I&#146;m aware of half a dozen or so
programs and APIs
with capabilities similar to those
of the RIT Classfile Library.
Why write another one?
Does the world need yet another library
for manipulating Java class files?
<P>
I wrote the RIT Classfile Library
because I wasn&#146;t satisfied
with the existing programs and libraries
for my purpose,
synthesizing remote method invocation stubs
in small devices
with limited (J2ME CLDC) Java environments.
Some programs are class file &#147;assemblers&#148;
that take their input from a source file;
this won&#146;t work in a small device with no file system,
and the code for parsing source text,
generating error messages, and so on
is unnecessary overhead for my purpose.
Some libraries are over-general,
with beautifully object-oriented designs
but quite large and complex class hierarchies;
the code footprint of such libraries
is problematic for small devices with limited memories.
Some libraries tangle analysis and synthesis capabilities
together in the same classes,
so that it&#146;s difficult to subset the library
to do just one or the other;
again, this leads to a larger than necessary
code footprint.
Some libraries expose the low-level details
of the Java class file data structures
like the &#147;constant pool&#148;
and the &#147;code attributes;&#148;
I find a high-level API that hides these details
easier to work with.
<P>
My goals in writing the RIT Classfile Library were
<UL>
<P><LI>
To hide the Java class file data structures
so I could work with high-level abstractions
rather than low-level details.
<P><LI>
To let a program synthesize class files directly
without involving source text as an intermediate step.
<P><LI>
To design a simple, minimal API,
the better to fit in small devices.
<P><LI>
To design an API that does both analysis and synthesis
of class files in a unified framework
but that can be easily subsetted to do just one or the other,
the better to fit in small devices.
<P><LI>
To avoid using Java Reflection,
which is not available in J2ME CLDC environments.

<A NAME="synthesizeclass"><H2>3. Synthesizing a Class</H2></A>

<P>
I assume you&#146;re familiar with JVM internals.
See the <A HREF="#references">References</A> for further information.

<P>
To synthesize a class,
first create an instance of class
<A HREF="SynthesizedClassDescription.html">SynthesizedClassDescription</A>.
A <B>class description</B> is an object
that holds information about everything that&#146;s in a class.
A <B>synthesized class description</B> is a class description
where you fill out (synthesize) the class information yourself.
(The other kind of class description,
an <B>analyzed class description,</B>
is a class description where the class information
comes from a pre-existing class file.
Analysis capabilities are not yet implemented
in the RIT Classfile Library.)
<P>
Once you have the synthesized class description object,
populate it with fields, methods, and whatever other information
the class needs.
Next, tell the synthesized class description object
to emit its binary class file into an output stream,
such as a FileOutputStream or a ByteArrayOutputStream.
Finally, to use your new class,
<A HREF="#classloading">load it into the JVM</A>
as described later.
<P>
When synthesizing your class,
you&#146;ll need to refer to other classes and types &#151;
for example, to specify the superclass of your class,
or to specify the data type for a field in your class.
A <B>type reference</B> is an object
that holds just enough information
to refer to some data type.
You can use any of several kinds of type reference:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="PrimitiveReference.html">PrimitiveReference</A>
is used to refer to a Java primitive type.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="NamedClassReference.html">NamedClassReference</A>
is used to refer to a Java class (or interface)
with a given name.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ArrayReference.html">ArrayReference</A>
is used to refer to an array of some component type.
<P><LI>
A class description can also be used as a type reference.
</UL>
<P>
To add a field to your class,
create a <B>field description</B> object,
which holds all information about the field.
You can use any of several kinds of field description:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedClassConstantFieldDescription.html">SynthesizedClassConstantFieldDescription</A>
for a static field initialized to a constant string or numeric value.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedClassFieldDescription.html">SynthesizedClassFieldDescription</A>
for other fields.
</UL>
<P>
To add a subroutine to your class,
create a <B>subroutine description</B> object,
which holds all information about the subroutine.
The term &#147;subroutine&#148; refers collectively
to constructors, methods, and class initializers.
You can use any of several kinds of subroutine description:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedConstructorDescription.html">SynthesizedConstructorDescription</A>
for a constructor.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedAbstractMethodDescription.html">SynthesizedAbstractMethodDescription</A>
for an abstract method.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedMethodDescription.html">SynthesizedMethodDescription</A>
for a regular method.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="SynthesizedClassInitializerDescription.html">SynthesizedClassInitializerDescription</A>
for a class initializer.
</UL>
<P>
Each subroutine (except an abstract method)
needs a sequence of bytecode instructions.
You use class <A HREF="Op.html">Op</A>
to obtain each instruction,
then you add each instruction to the subroutine description.
You can also add instances of class <A HREF="Location.html">Location</A>
to mark the target locations for branch instructions.
<P>
Some bytecode instructions refer to fields or methods
that exist elsewhere.
To refer to a field,
use a <B>field reference</B> object.
Class <A HREF="NamedFieldReference.html">NamedFieldReference</A>
lets you refer to a field by name.
A field description can also be used as a field reference.
<P>
To refer to a subroutine,
use a <B>subroutine reference</B> object.
You can use any of several kinds of subroutine reference:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ConstructorReference.html">ConstructorReference</A>
lets you refer to a constructor.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="MethodReference.html">MethodReference</A>
lets you refer to a method.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ClassInitializerReference.html">ClassInitializerReference</A>
lets you refer to a class initializer.
<P><LI>
A subroutine description can also be used
as a subroutine reference.
</UL>
<P>
There are two very important pieces of information
you must specify for each subroutine
(except an abstract method):
<B><TT>max_stack</TT>,</B>
which gives the maximum number of words
the subroutine ever pushes on the operand stack,
and <B><TT>max_locals</TT>,</B>
which gives the number of words needed to hold
the subroutine&#146;s <TT>this</TT> pointer, arguments,
and local variables.
If you don&#146;t specify the correct
<TT>max_stack</TT> and <TT>max_locals</TT>,
your class may fail verification when loaded,
or your subroutine may behave incorrectly when invoked.

<P>

<A NAME="synthesizeinterface"><H2>4. Synthesizing an Interface</H2></A>

<P>
To synthesize an interface,
first create an instance of class
<A HREF="SynthesizedInterfaceDescription.html">SynthesizedInterfaceDescription</A>.
An <B>interface description</B> is an object
that holds information about everything that&#146;s in an interface.
A <B>synthesized interface description</B> is an interface description
where you fill out (synthesize) the interface information yourself.
(The other kind of interface description,
an <B>analyzed interface description,</B>
is an interface description where the interface information
comes from a pre-existing class file.
Analysis capabilities are not yet implemented
in the RIT class file Library.)
<P>
Once you have the synthesized interface description object,
you work with it in exactly the same way
as a synthesized class description object.
Populate it with fields, methods, and whatever other information
the interface needs.
Next, tell the synthesized interface description object
to emit its binary class file into an output stream,
such as a FileOutputStream or a ByteArrayOutputStream.
Finally, to use your new interface,
<A HREF="#classloading">load it into the JVM</A>
as described later.
<P>
The only fields you can have in an interface
are public static final fields.
To add such a field to your interface,
create a field description object that is an instance of
class <A HREF="SynthesizedInterfaceFieldDescription.html">SynthesizedInterfaceFieldDescription</A>.
<P>
The only methods you can have in an interface
are public abstract methods.
To add such a method to your interface,
create a subroutine description object that is an instance of
class <A HREF="SynthesizedInterfaceMethodDescription.html">SynthesizedInterfaceMethodDescription</A>.
An interface can also have a class initializer
(class <A HREF="SynthesizedClassInitializerDescription.html">SynthesizedClassInitializerDescription</A>)
to initialize the interface&#146;s fields if necessary.
</UL>

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="classloading"><H2>5. Loading Synthesized Classes</H2></A>

<P>
After you&#146;ve filled everything out,
a synthesized class description object
lets you emit the binary class file
into an output stream.
(Everything in this section applies to synthesized interfaces too.
For brevity, I&#146;ll omit mentioning interfaces.)
To create actual instances of the synthesized class,
you have to load this class file into the JVM.
Two strategies are possible.
<P>
You can store the binary class file in a file
(using a FileOutputStream),
placing the file where a class loader can find it.
For example, you can place the file
in the proper directory
in the system class loader&#146;s <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>.
Or you can place the file in any old directory,
and use a URLClassLoader
to get the file from the proper <TT>"file://"</TT> URL.
Or you can place the file
where an HTTP server can retrieve it,
and use a URLClassLoader
to get the file from the proper <TT>"http://"</TT> URL.
<P>
Alternatively, you can feed the binary class file
directly into a class loader,
bypassing the file system altogether.
The RIT Classfile Library
provides a special class loader implementation
for this purpose,
class <A HREF="DirectClassLoader.html">DirectClassLoader</A>.
To feed a class file into a direct class loader,
you obtain an output stream from the direct class loader
and emit the synthesized class file into this output stream.
When later told to load that class,
the direct class loader gets the class file
from the bytes that were written.
