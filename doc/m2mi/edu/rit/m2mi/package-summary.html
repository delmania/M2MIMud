<P>
Remote method invocation (RMI) [<A HREF="#WRW96">WRW96</A>]
can be viewed as
an object oriented abstraction
of point-to-point communication:
what looks like a method call
is in fact a message sent
and a response sent back.
In the same way,
M2MI can be viewed as
an object oriented abstraction
of broadcast communication.

<P>
<H3>1.1. Handles</H3>

<P>
M2MI lets an application invoke a method
declared in an interface.
To do so,
the application needs
some kind of "reference"
upon which to perform the invocation.
In M2MI, a reference is called a <EM>handle,</EM>
and there are three varieties,
omnihandles, unihandles, and multihandles.

<P>
<H3>1.2. Omnihandles</H3>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig1.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 1: An omnihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
An <EM>omnihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "every object out there
that implements this interface."
An application can ask the M2MI Layer
to create an omnihandle for a certain interface <I>X</I>,
called the omnihandle's <EM>target interface</EM>.
Figure 1 depicts an omnihandle for interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the omnihandle is named <TT>allFoos</TT>.
It is created by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo allFoos = (Foo) M2MI.getOmnihandle (Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig2.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 2: Invoking a method on an omnihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once an omnihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the omnihandle for interface <I>X</I> means,
"Every object out there that implements interface <I>X</I>,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
The method is performed by whichever objects
implementing interface <I>X</I>
exist at the time the method is <EM>invoked</EM> on the omnihandle.
Thus, different objects could respond to an omnihandle invocation
at different times.
Figure 2 shows what happens
when the statement <TT>allFoos.y();</TT> is executed.
Three objects implementing interface <TT>Foo</TT>,
objects <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>D</I>,
happen to be in existence at that time;
so all three objects perform method <TT>y()</TT>.
<P>
The target objects invoked by an M2MI method call
need not reside in the same process
as the calling object.
The target objects can reside
in other processes and/or other devices.
As long as the target objects
are in range to receive a broadcast
from the calling object over the network,
the M2MI Layer will find the target objects
and perform a <EM>remote</EM> method invocation
on each one.
(M2MI's remote method invocation does not, however,
use the same mechanism as Java RMI.)

<P>
<H3>1.3. Exporting Objects</H3>

<P>
To receive invocations on a certain interface <I>X</I>,
an application creates an object
that implements interface <I>X</I>
and <EM>exports</EM> the object to the M2MI Layer.
Thereafter,
the M2MI Layer will invoke that object's method <I>Y</I>
whenever anyone calls method <I>Y</I>
on an omnihandle for interface <I>X</I>.
An object is exported with code like this:
<PRE>
M2MI.export (b, Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
In the above line of code,
<TT>b</TT> is the object being exported,
and <TT>Foo.class</TT> is the class of the target interface
through which M2MI invocations
will come to the object.
We say the object is "exported as type <TT>Foo</TT>."
M2MI also lets an object
be exported multiple times with multiple target interfaces
(provided the object implements all those interfaces).
<P>
Once exported,
an object stays exported
until explicitly unexported with code like this:
<PRE>
M2MI.unexport (b);</PRE>
<P>
In other words, M2MI does not do
distributed garbage collection (DGC).
In many distributed collaborative applications,
DGC is unwanted;
an object that is exported by one device
as part of a distributed application
should remain exported
even if there are no other devices
invoking the object yet.
In cases where DGC is needed,
it can be provided by a leasing mechanism
explicit in the interface.
Omitting DGC simplifies M2MI.

<P>
<H3>1.4. Unihandles</H3>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig3.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 3: A unihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
A <EM>unihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "one particular object out there
that implements this interface."
An application can export an object
and have the M2MI Layer return a unihandle for that object.
Unlike an omnihandle,
a unihandle is bound to one particular object
at the time the unihandle is created.
Figure 3 depicts a unihandle for object <TT>b</TT>
implementing interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the unihandle is named <TT>b_Foo</TT>.
It is created by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo b_Foo = (Foo) M2MI.getUnihandle (b, Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig4.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 4: Invoking a method on a unihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once a unihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the unihandle means,
"The particular object out there associated with this unihandle,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
When the statement <TT>b_Foo.y();</TT> is executed,
only object <TT>B</TT> performs the method,
as shown in Figure 4.
As with an omnihandle,
the target object for a unihandle invocation
need not reside in the same process or device
as the calling object.

<P>
<H3>1.5. Multihandles</H3>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig5.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 5: A multihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
A <EM>multihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "one particular set of objects out there
that implement this interface."
Unlike a unihandle which only refers to one object,
a multihandle can refer to one or more than one object.
But unlike an omnihandle
which automatically refers to all objects
that implement a certain target interface,
a multihandle only refers to those objects
that have been explicitly <EM>attached</EM> to the multihandle.
Figure 5 depicts a multihandle
implementing target interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the multihandle is named <TT>some_Foos</TT>,
and it is attached to two objects, <TT>a</TT> and <TT>d</TT>.
The multihandle is created and attached to the objects
by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo someFoos = (Foo) M2MI.getMultihandle (Foo.class);
((Multihandle) someFoos).attach (a);
((Multihandle) someFoos).attach (d);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig6.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 6: Invoking a method on a multihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once a multihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the multihandle means,
"The particular object or objects out there
associated with this multihandle,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
When the statement <TT>someFoos.y();</TT> is executed,
objects <TT>a</TT> and <TT>d</TT> perform the method,
but not objects <TT>b</TT> or <TT>c</TT>,
as shown in Figure 6.
As with an omnihandle or unihandle,
the target objects for a multihandle invocation
need not reside in the same process or device
as the calling object or each other.
<P>
An object can also be detached from a multihandle
by code like this:
<PRE>
((Multihandle) someFoos).detach (a);</PRE>

<P>
<H3>1.6. Characteristics of M2MI Invocations</H3>

<P>
Methods in interfaces invoked via M2MI
can have arguments.
When a value of a primitive type
is passed as an M2MI method call argument,
the argument is <EM>passed by copy</EM>
as in regular Java;
manipulations of the argument by the called object
do not affect the original argument in the calling object.

<P>
When an object of a non-primitive type
(including an array type)
is passed as an M2MI method call argument, however,
the manner in which the argument is passed
depends on whether the called object
is in the same process as the calling object.
If the called object is in the same process
as the calling object,
the argument is <EM>passed by reference</EM>
as in regular Java;
manipulations of the argument in the called object
do affect the original argument in the calling object.
However, if the called object is not in the same process
as the calling object,
the argument is <EM>passed by copy;</EM>
manipulations of the argument in the called object
do <EM>not</EM> affect the original argument in the calling object.

<P>
Omnihandles, unihandles, and multihandles
can be passed as M2MI method call arguments.
A handle behaves the same way in the called object
as it does in the calling object:
whenever a method is invoked on a handle,
the object or objects associated with the handle
execute the method,
no matter which processes the objects reside in.
Thus, handles are similar to <EM>remote references</EM>
in Java RMI.
When a handle to an object
is passed as a method call argument,
the object is effectively <EM>passed by reference</EM>
even if the called object
is not in the same process as the calling object.
Invocations performed by the method call recipient
on the argument (handle)
come back to the original object via M2MI
and thus do affect the original object.

<P>
M2MI uses Java's object serialization
to marshal the method call arguments on the calling side
and unmarshal them again on the target side.
Accordingly, every non-primitive object
passed in as an M2MI method call argument
must be serializable,
or the invocation will fail.

<P>
While M2MI can pass objects as arguments like Java RMI,
M2MI does not download the argument objects' classes
to the destination as Java RMI does.
With M2MI, the destination must already possess
the argument objects' classes,
or the invocation will fail.
If a handle is passed as an argument
in an M2MI method call, though,
the destination need only possess
the handle's target interface or interfaces.
(The destination's M2MI Layer
already possesses all the classes needed
to implement the handles themselves.)

<P>
Although they can have arguments,
methods in interfaces invoked via M2MI
must be declared not to return a value
and not to throw any exceptions.
This is because with potentially more than one object
performing the method,
there is no single return value or exception to return or throw.

<P>
Since an M2MI method does not return anything,
the caller cannot get any information back from the called object
<EM>in the same method call.</EM>
If the caller needs to get information back,
the caller can send a reference to its own object
by passing the object's unihandle
as an argument to a method invoked on a handle.
The called object or objects can then send information back
by performing subsequent method invocations
on the original caller's unihandle.
This typically leads to a pattern of <EM>asynchronous</EM>
method calls and callbacks
in an M2MI-based application;
in other words, an <EM>event-driven</EM> application.

<P>
For the same reason,
an M2MI method invocation
does not give any indication
of whether the invocation was successfully communicated
to the called objects.
If an M2MI-based application needs an acknowledgment
that a method call in fact reached the called objects,
the called objects must do a separate method invocation
back to the calling object.
However, some applications can be designed
not to need explicit method acknowledgments at all,
achieving fault recovery by other means.

<P>
Finally, M2MI invocations are <EM>non-blocking.</EM>
An M2MI method call returns immediately
to the calling object
without waiting for all the target objects
to execute their methods.
Later, when the method invocations are actually performed,
every method in every target object is (potentially) executed
concurrently by a separate thread.
Therefore, every object exported via M2MI
must be designed to be multiple thread safe.
Furthermore, like any concurrent application,
the overall M2MI-based application
must be designed to avoid deadlocks,
to work properly
with any ordering of the concurrent method calls,
and so on.

<P>

<A NAME="writing"><H2>2. Working With the M2MI Library</H2></A>

<P>
This section gives an overview
of how to write M2MI-based applications
using the M2MI Library.
For more detailed information,
refer to the documentation
for the various classes and methods.

<P>
The key component is class <A HREF="M2MI.html">M2MI</A>,
which encapsulates the M2MI Layer
and provides static methods for working with M2MI.
Also important are the <A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> class
and its subclasses
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html">Omnihandle</A>,
<A HREF="Unihandle.html">Unihandle</A>, and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html">Multihandle</A>.

<P>
<H3>2.1. Initialization</H3>

<P>
Before doing anything else in your application,
you must initialize the M2MI Layer by calling the
<A HREF="M2MI.html#initialize()"><TT>M2MI.initialize()</TT></A> method.
At run time,
this method gets the parameters it needs
to configure the M2MI Layer
from the M2MI properties file
(see "<A HREF="#configuring">Configuring the M2MI Layer</A>").

<P>
<H3>2.2. Working With Omnihandles</H3>

<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via an omnihandle, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#export(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.export(Object,Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and the target interface with which to export it.

<P>
To export an object with multiple target interfaces, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#export(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.export(Object,Class)</TT></A>
multiple times,
specifying the object to be exported
and a different target interface in each call.

<P>
To obtain an omnihandle for a certain target interface, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getOmnihandle(java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getOmnihandle(Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the target interface.
An omnihandle is returned.

<P>
The returned omnihandle object extends classes
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html">Omnihandle</A>.
The returned omnihandle object also implements
the specified target interface.
Typically, you cast the returned omnihandle
to the target interface
before storing the omnihandle.
To invoke a certain target method
on all exported objects
that implement an omnihandle's target interface,
call the target method on the omnihandle object.

<P>
An exported object can be unexported by calling
<A HREF="M2MI.html#unexport(java.lang.Object)"><TT>M2MI.unexport(Object)</TT></A>,
specifying the desired object.
Afterwards, the object can no longer be invoked
via <EM>any</EM> handle
(omnihandle, unihandle, or multihandle)
that formerly referred to that object.

<P>
An omnihandle implements the
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, omnihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.3. Working With Unihandles</H3>

<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via a unihandle, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getUnihandle(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getUnihandle(Object,Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and the target interface with which to export it.
The object must in fact implement the target interface.
A unihandle attached to that object is returned.

<P>
You can create multiple unihandles
that refer to the same target object
by calling
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getUnihandle(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getUnihandle(Object,Class)</TT></A>
multiple times.
Each call returns a different unihandle.
Each unihandle implements just one target interface.
If the target object implements multiple target interfaces,
different unihandles for the same object
can implement different target interfaces.

<P>
The returned unihandle object extends classes
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Unihandle.html">Unihandle</A>.
The returned unihandle object also implements
the specified target interface.
Typically, you cast the returned unihandle
to the target interface
before storing the unihandle.
To invoke a certain target method
on the exported object attached to a unihandle,
call the target method on the unihandle object.

<P>
When an object is exported
and attached to a unihandle
for a certain target interface,
the object can also be invoked
via an omnihandle for that target interface.

<P>
A unihandle is always attached to at most one exported object.
You can attach a unihandle to a different object by calling
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#attach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>attach()</TT></A>
on the unihandle object.
However, you can only do this
in the same process that originally created the unihandle.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the unihandle object
will be executed by the new target object
instead of the old target object.
The old target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the old target object.

<P>
You can also detach a unihandle from its target object by calling
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#detach()"><TT>detach()</TT></A>
on the unihandle object.
Again, you can only do this
in the same process that originally created the unihandle.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the unihandle object
will no longer be executed by any object.
The old target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the old target object.
Once a unihandle is detached,
the unihandle becomes unusable
and you cannot later attach another object to it.
If you need to do that, use a multihandle instead.

<P>
A unihandle implements the
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, unihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.4. Working With Multihandles</H3>

<P>
To establish a set of specific target objects
that are all invoked together,
first create a multihandle,
then attach the target objects to the multihandle.
<P>
To obtain a multihandle for a certain target interface, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getMultihandle(java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getMultihandle(Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the target interface.
A multihandle is returned.

<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via a multihandle, call
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#attach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>attach(Object)</TT></A>
on the multihandle,
specifying the object to be attached.
The object must in fact implement
the multihandle's target interface.
You can attach the same object to multiple multihandles.

<P>
The multihandle object extends classes
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html">Multihandle</A>.
The returned multihandle object also implements
the specified target interface.
Typically, you cast the returned multihandle
to the target interface
before storing the multihandle.
To invoke a certain target method
on every exported object attached to a multihandle,
call the target method on the multihandle object.

<P>
A target object can be detached from a multihandle by calling
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#detach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>detach(Object)</TT></A>
on the multihandle,
specifying the object to be detached.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the multihandle object
will no longer be executed by the target object.
The target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the object.

<P>
A multihandle implements the
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, multihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.5. Exceptions During M2MI Invocations</H3>

<P>
While an M2MI-callable method
cannot throw any checked exceptions (type Exception),
it can throw unchecked exceptions (type RuntimeException or Error).
Unchecked exceptions can be thrown in two contexts:
when a calling object is invoking a target method on a handle,
and when the M2MI Layer is invoking a target method
on an actual target object.

<P>
When a calling object invokes a target method on a handle,
the ultimate target objects are not invoked just yet,
so no exceptions of any kind
are thrown from the target objects to the calling object.
However, the M2MI Layer may throw an unchecked exception
to the calling object
if it is unable to set up the invocation.
The unchecked exception may be an
<A HREF="InvocationException.html">InvocationException</A>
indicating a failure to serialize
one of the method's arguments;
make sure all the arguments are serializable.
The InvocationException may also indicate
a failure to send an outgoing message
to trigger invocations on objects
in other processes or devices.
The unchecked exception may also be
any other RuntimeException or Error,
typically indicating a software defect
in the M2MI Layer.

<P>
When the M2MI Layer invokes a target method
on an actual target object,
the target method will not throw any checked exceptions
(otherwise it could not have been invoked via M2MI).
However, the target method
or the M2MI Layer itself
may throw an unchecked exception.
The M2MI Layer can be configured
so that such exceptions cause a stack trace
to be printed on the standard error stream
of the process containing the target object.
However, the M2MI Layer continues to operate.
The unchecked exception may be an
<A HREF="InvocationException.html">InvocationException</A>
indicating a failure to deserialize
one of the method's arguments;
make sure all the arguments are serializable.
The InvocationException may also indicate
that the destination process cannot find the class
for one of the method's arguments;
make sure the destination process possesses
all the requisite classes.
(M2MI does not automatically download classes
like Java RMI does.)
The unchecked exception may also be
any other RuntimeException or Error,
typically indicating a software defect
in the M2MI Layer.

The above sections have described the details
of how to work with the M2MI Library.
What about the high level?
How does one design a complete M2MI-based application?

<P>
Unfortunately, we can't give you much specific guidance.

we are still exploring applications suitable for M2MI,
and we are not yet certain of the appropriate design patterns
for M2MI-based applications.

<A NAME="configuring"><H2>3. Configuring the M2MI Layer</H2></A>

<P>
Both the M2MI Layer and the M2MP Layer are configured
by means of a "device properties file"
containing a device ID value.
Typically, the device properties file
is named <TT>"device.properties"</TT>
and resides in the home directory of your account.
With the device properties file located in your home directory,
every application that runs in your account
will use the same device ID.
Another possibility
is to put the <TT>"device.properties"</TT> file
in a subdirectory;
then every application that runs in that subdirectory
will use that file to get the device ID
(instead of the file in your home directory if any).
See class <A HREF="../device/DeviceProperties.html">DeviceProperties</A>
for further information
about where the device properties file can be located.

<P>
Here is the typical recommended contents
of the device properties file.
If you use this example,
be sure to change the value

<P>
The M2MI Layer is also configured
by means of an "M2MI properties file"
containing a number of configuration settings.
Typically, the M2MI properties file
is named <TT>"m2mi.properties"</TT>
and resides in the home directory of your account.
With the M2MI properties file located in your home directory,
every application that runs in your account
will use the same configuration for the M2MI Layer.
Another possibility
is to put the <TT>"m2mi.properties"</TT> file
in a subdirectory;
then every application that runs in that subdirectory
will use that file to configure the M2MI Layer
(instead of the file in your home directory if any).

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/m2miarch.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 7: M2MI architecture</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
As Figure 7 shows,
when a calling object invokes a method on a handle,
M2MI invocations may need to go to three places:
to exported objects in the same process as the calling object,
to exported objects in other processes on the same device,
and to exported objects in other devices.

<P>
<H3>5.1. M2MI Invocations Within the Same Process</H3>

<P>
An M2MI invocation begins with a handle.
The handle contains two things:
the handle's target interface,
and a globally-unique <EM>exported object identifier</EM> (EOID).
For a unihandle,
the EOID designates a single exported object.
For a multihandle,
the EOID designates a group of exported objects.
For an omnihandle,
the EOID is a wildcard value
designating all objects that implement
the handle's target interface.
The M2MI Layer sets the handle's EOID and target interface
when the handle is created.

<P>
The calling object kicks things off
by invoking a method on the handle.
The handle creates a <EM>method invoker</EM> object,
which knows how to invoke the target method on a given target object,
and which contains the target method's argument values if any.
The handle also creates an <EM>invocation</EM> object
encapsulating the following information:
(a) the EOID from the handle;
(b) a method descriptor consisting of
the target interface name,
the target method name,
and the target method's argument types;
and (c) the method invoker object
(including the argument values).
The handle then hands the invocation object off to the M2MI Layer.
The M2MI Layer attempts to map the EOID (for a unihandle or multihandle)
or the target interface name (for an omnihandle)
to the associated exported objects.
If any are found,
the M2MI Layer puts the invocation object in a queue.
One or more separate <EM>invocation threads</EM>
read the queue
and tell the method invoker object
to perform the actual method calls on the target objects,
using the argument values stored in the method invoker object.

<P>
<H3>5.2. M2MI Invocations to Other Processes Within the Same Device</H3>

<P>
The M2MI Layer uses the Many-to-Many Protocol (M2MP)
to broadcast the invocation to other processes and devices.
The M2MI Layer generates an M2MP message
containing a serialized version of the invocation object,
and sends the message via the M2MP Layer.

<P>
The M2MP Layer is responsible
for broadcasting each M2MI invocation message
to all processes running M2MI
in the same device and other devices.
See package <A HREF="../m2mp/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp</A>
for a description of the M2MP Layer's architecture.
Each packet of the invocation message goes
to the M2MP Daemon process
running in the same device
via kernel shared memory.
The M2MP Daemon process
sends a copy of each packet
to every instance of the M2MP Layer
running in other processes on the same device,
again via kernel shared memory.
(Specifically, the packets are sent through socket connections
to the M2MP Daemon process on the local host,
which are typically implemented via kernel shared memory.)
Thus, an outgoing M2MP message sent by one process
becomes an incoming M2MP message received by every other process.

<P>
The M2MP Layer matches each incoming message
against a group of <EM>message filters.</EM>
Only those incoming messages that match a message filter
will be passed on to the M2MI Layer;
other incoming messages are discarded.
When the M2MI Layer exports an object
to be invoked by an omnihandle,
the M2MI Layer registers a message filter
that will match an M2MI message
containing the omnihandle's target interface.
When the M2MI Layer exports an object
to be invoked by a unihandle or multihandle,
the M2MI Layer registers a message filter
that will match an M2MI message
containing the unihandle's or multihandle's EOID.
Thus, the M2MI Layer will receive from the M2MP Layer
only those M2MI messages
that will result in invocations on objects
actually exported in the M2MI Layer.

<P>
When it receives an incoming M2MI invocation message,
the M2MI Layer deserializes the message
and reconstitutes the invocation object.
The M2MI Layer then proceeds to process the invocation object
exactly as described before,
causing the target method to be invoked
on the target object(s).

<P>
<H3>5.3. M2MI Invocations to Other Devices</H3>

<P>
To send M2MI invocations between devices,
the M2MP Daemon process
forwards a copy of each outgoing M2MP message
to the external broadcast network
as well as to the local M2MP client processes.
The M2MP Daemon process
also listens to the external broadcast network,
receives incoming messages from other devices,
and forwards copies
to each M2MP client process.
On the external broadcast network,
message packets are conveyed as UDP datagrams
sent to to a multicast IP address
(if there is more than one other device)
or to a unicast IP address
(if there is just one other device).

<P>
Once an M2MI invocation message from another device
is sent to an M2MP client process,
the message is processed in exactly the same way
as messages originating within the same device.

<P>
The M2MP Daemon process
could interface to the external broadcast network
in different ways.
It could use UDP datagrams over an 802.11 wireless Ethernet.
It could send M2MP messages
directly in Ethernet frames
rather than going through the TCP/IP stack.
It could use some other wireless networking technology.
Future work on M2MI
will explore these possibilities.

<P>

Other remote method invocation systems,
such as CORBA and Java RMI,
are implemented using <EM>proxies</EM>.
On the calling side,
a <EM>sending proxy</EM> or <EM>stub</EM>
converts a method call to an outgoing message.
On the called side,
a <EM>receiving proxy</EM> or <EM>skeleton</EM>
converts an incoming message
back into a method call on the target object.
The classes for the stub and skeleton objects
typically must be generated, compiled,
and installed before starting the system,
although Java RMI lets proxy classes be downloaded
at run time from a codebase server.

<P>
M2MI is also implemented using proxies:
the handle is the sending proxy,
and the method invoker is the receiving proxy.
However, the classes for M2MI handles and method invokers
do not have to be generated, compiled, and installed
ahead of time.
Instead, the M2MI Layer automatically <EM>synthesizes</EM>
the binary class file
for each handle class and each method invoker class,
as needed, at run time,
and automatically loads each synthesized class
into the Java Virtual Machine
using a special internal class loader.
This eliminates all the extra work
associated with RMI proxies
and makes M2MI-based applications
easier to develop and deploy.

<P>
To synthesize its handle and method invoker classes,
the M2MI Layer makes use of the RIT Classfile Library,
a general purpose library for class file synthesis.
See package <A HREF="../classfile/package-summary.html">edu.rit.classfile</A>
for further information.

<P>
<H3>5.5. Queuing Behavior</H3>

<P>
M2MI is a queuing system.
Application threads perform invocations on handles;
separate threads inside the M2MI Layer
actually invoke the target objects.
Invocations are placed in a queue to await processing.

<P>
As in any queuing system,
it is possible to put items into the queue
faster than they are taken out.
That is,
it is possible to write an M2MI-based application
where one or more threads
generate M2MI invocations so quickly
that the threads inside the M2MI Layer
do not get enough CPU time
to read and process all the invocations.
If this happens, the invocation messages
will queue up in the M2MP Layer and/or the M2MI Layer.
If the queue grows too large,
the Java Virtual Machine's memory space will become exhausted,
and the application will start throwing OutOfMemoryExceptions.
If this happens,
the application must be redesigned
so invocations are not performed
faster than they can be processed.
